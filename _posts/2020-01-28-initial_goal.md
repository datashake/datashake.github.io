# Data Scientist path

## Goal

I want to invest this year into becoming a (real) data scientist. My journey will look like this (check here again for updates):

1. Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng ([link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome))
1. Deep Learning specialization by Andrew Ng ([link](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning))
1. Fast.ai deep learning courses ([link](https://www.fast.ai/))

I will write again here, in order to give updates on my progress.
